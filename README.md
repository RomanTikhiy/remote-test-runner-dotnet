# Remote test runner

## Here is the approach of running unit tests remotely using `.NET 6`.

The work is done simply by calling `dotnet test` by separate cmd process.
This sample could be used for creating any custom system which executes unit tests remotely or even for some educational applications.

## Nice to do:
  - refactor existing approach
  - implement auth
  - save all users' attempts into the database
  - implement different excercises and tasks
  - implement frontend part using `react` or `angular`
  - deploy the system to cloud provider like `Azure`
  - implement CI/CD process
  - enjoy :slightly_smiling_face:
